# Python For Data Sciences

Python is often described as powerful, yet easy to learn. It is a general purpose programming language, yet it comes with thousands of libraries for working with data. It is often the first language people learn, yet it is the language people use decades later in their career. Python is often the first tool people grab when they need to create a quick prototype, yet it is the language that powers some of the most complex projects.
